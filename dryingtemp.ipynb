The ASA support was prepared by homogeneous deposition-precipitation of Al3+ on silica (∼5 wt% Al2O3 on SiO2) followed by calcination [45]. γ-alumina (Ketjen CK-300), silica (Shell) and activated carbon (NORIT RX-3 extra) were used as received. The acidic properties of the used ASA, SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported elsewhere [46]. The textural properties of all support materials are collected in Table 1. Prior to impregnation, a sieved fraction of these materials (125–250 μm) was dried overnight at 110 °C. For NiMo-NTA catalysts, the impregnation solution contained the chelating agent nitrilotriacetic acid (VWR, 99% purity), ammonium heptamolybdate (Merck, 99% purity) and nickel nitrate (VWR, 99% purity) in concentrations to obtain a final Mo loading of 8 wt% and an atomic Ni/Mo ratio of 0.3.

For the former preparation method [Pt(acac)2] (acac = acetylacetonate), corresponding to the desired wt% of Pt on the final catalyst, was dissolved in a volume of dichloromethane (DCM) corresponding to the pore volume, as determined by mercury porosimetry, of the oxidic Co-Mo catalyst to be modified. After 30 min impregnation time, the sample was air dried at room temperature for 30 min followed by drying at 250 °C in air for 1 h. For the latter preparation method, [Pt(NH3)4](HCO3)2 was dissolved into a commercial Co-Mo liquor, followed by pore volume filling impregnation of an alumina carrier. This also yielded catalysts with 16 wt% Mo and 3.5 wt% Co.

Typically, 1 g of each of 1RSH, 2RSH and 5RSH silica supports was dispersed in 0.1272 g of nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate and 0.2224 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in deionized water. The solution was stirred continuously to near dry, then subjected to drying under ambient conditions. The air-dried samples were further dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The resultant catalyst oxides (1RSH-NM, 2RSH-NM and 5RSH-NM) were later subjected to in-situ activation. During the dispersion of 5RSH silica support in deionized water, the support was noticed to demonstrate some hydrophobicity due to the concentration of thiol group on the silica surface and therefore did not mix efficiently with the deionized water and the metal precursors at the early stage of stirring. Thus, another 1.0 g portion of 5RSH support was further dispersed in ethanol solution containing dissolved 0.1272 g of nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate, and a concentrated solution of 0.2224 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate was subsequently added to the mixture dropwise to ensure homogeneity of the system.

Cylindrical γ -Al2O3pellets (Engelhard, 3 mm in both length and diameter), whichwere calcined at 600 ◦C for 6 h and stored at 120 ◦C, were applied. The pore volume of this support material was 1.0 ml/g,and its surface area was 200 m2/g. The point of zero charge(pzc) of the γ -Al2O3 pellets was 8.9. The volume of the impregnated solutions was equal to the pore volume of the γ -Al2O3sample plus 10%. Impregnated samples were kept in a closed vessel to prevent dehydration. All samples were aged for 5 min, dried in a preheated tubular oven in dried at 120 °C for 2 h, and finally heated in nitrogen at 550 ◦C (at a heating rate of 3 ◦C/min) for 3 h. These samples are referred to as calcined samples (c). Samples are labeledx(w), x(d), and x(c), where x refers to the impregnation solution used (see below) and (w), (d), and (c) refer to wet, dried,and calcined samples, respectively. Wet [x(w)] and dried [x(d)]samples taken for analysis were discarded after UV–vis measurements to ensure that the calcined samples [x(c)] were not exposed to air after the start of the drying and calcination steps. The Co concentration in all impregnation solutions was 1.35 M, corresponding to a metal content of 8.0 wt% after reduction. This amount of metal contained within the sampleswas chosen because it is a compromise between obtaining good spectroscopic data, which is limited by high metal loadings, andrelevant FT catalysis, which is usually performed over catalysts with Co content >10 wt% [1]. The compositions of the impregnation solutions and the main absorption band in the visible part of the UV–vis spectra [14] are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Dry EtOH (Merck, p.a.) was obtained by distillation from Mg and stored over 4-Å molecular sieves. A water-free solution of Co(NO3)2 in dry EtOH (2) was obtained by reacting 3.93 g (13.5 mmol) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Acros, p.a.)with 4.40 g (29.7 mmol) of ethyl orthoformate (Acros, p.a.)to remove crystal water. Excess ethyl orthoformate and EtOH,formed on reaction, were then removed under reduced pressure.The deep-purple anhydrous Co(NO3)2 crystals thus obtained were redissolved in dry EtOH in a dry nitrogen atmosphere to a total volume of 10 ml (1.35 M Co). Solution 4 was prepared in the same manner, with citric acid (OPG Pharma, p.a.)added to the Co(NO3)2·6H2O before reaction with ethyl orthoformate. Aqueous solutions containing citric acid as additional ligand (3 and 5) were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of citric acid in water before adding the Co salt[Co(NO3)2 and CoCO3 (Acros, p.a.), respectively]. Basic solution 6 was prepared as described in the patent literature [15];25.4 g (264 mmol) of (NH4)2CO3 (Acros, p.a.) was dissolved in 100 ml of a 25 wt% ammonia solution (Merck, p.a.) under gentle heating.

Afterward, the sample was washed to neutralize the pH, oven-dried and calcined. The desilicated sample was further exchanged with 0.5 M NH4NO3 at 60 °C for 1 h in three consecutive cycles of ion exchange and centrifugation. The final sample after extensive water washing was dried at 80 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. Ni and Mo were loaded onto commercial and dealuminated/desilicated USY-zeolite samples using a wet impregnation method. The required amount of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was first dissolved in water and then added dropwise to the zeolite. The mixture was then stirred for 0.5 h at 25 °C. Water was removed via rotary evaporation (85 °C). The resultant mixture was then oven-dried and calcined in air at 450 °C (5 °C/min) for 4 h. The resulting catalysts are abbreviated as NiMo(D)YXX where NiMo stands for Ni and Mo, D for desilication when used, Y for ultra-stable Y zeolite, and XX for the silica-alumina ratio.')\n",
